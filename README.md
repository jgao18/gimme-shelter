# InShelter

InShelter is an easy to use web application allowing homeless users to connect with shelters and remotely reserve a place to sleep.

## Our Mission



## Client Registration

Clients in need can access the website *(insert domain name here)* via a mobile phone browser or library computer in order to register for the service, which will allow them to reserve beds at nearby registered shelters.

Once a client is registered, InShelter provides information to them on shelters they qualify for according to gender, financial situation, etc. These available shelters are then ranked by distance from the client and relevant address and identifying information is provided.

## Shelter Registration

Shelters have their own registration form at *(insert domain name here)* which makes them visible to nearby clients and tracks reservations and availability as clients make and drop reservations.
